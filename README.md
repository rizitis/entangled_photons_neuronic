Just an entangled photons neuronic theory for photonic processors... 


In quantum physics, entangled photons can exhibit correlations that defy classical understanding. The state of entangled photons, denoted as (γ1,γ2)(γ1​,γ2​), cannot simply be represented by a sequence like "αβ" or "βα". Instead, it reflects quantum phenomena such as symmetry or superposition of individual states "α" and "β".

These quantum correlations can lead to results that are not just misunderstood but fundamentally different from classical physics concepts.

Algebraic Formula:
The quantum state of entangled photons can be represented as:
(γ1,γ2)=αβ±βα(γ1​,γ2​)=αβ±βα

Here, αα and ββ represent the quantum states carried by the photons γ1γ1​ and γ2γ2​, respectively. The ±± sign indicates that the state can exhibit either symmetric (for bosons) or antisymmetric (for fermions) properties under exchange of photons.

This formula encapsulates the quantum nature of entangled photons, highlighting their non-classical correlations and the challenges they pose to classical interpretations.

### Scenario Description and Algebraic Representation

   1. Neural Network Overview: We have a large neural network consisting of multiple neurons. Each neuron receives inputs γiγi​ and has corresponding weights wiwi​ and biases bibi​.

   2. Quantum-inspired Representation: In the context of quantum-inspired neural networks, the inputs γiγi​ can be considered analogous to quantum states, and the weights wiwi​ as operations that transform these states.

   3. Tensor Product Representation: The combined effect of each input γiγi​ with its weight wiwi​ is expressed using the tensor product γi⊗wiγi​⊗wi​. This represents the entangled or combined state of the input and its weight in a quantum-inspired framework.

   4. Bias Contribution: Each neuron also includes a bias term bibi​, which represents an additional constant adjustment to the weighted sum of inputs before passing through an activation function.

   5. Algebraic Expression: The entire system of inputs, weights, and biases across all neurons in the neural network can be algebraically represented as:

  ###  Explanation


  1.  Tensor Product (γi⊗wiγi​⊗wi​): This represents the quantum-inspired combination of an input state γiγi​ with its weight wiwi​. It captures the interaction or entanglement between the input and the weight in a quantum analogy.

  2.  Bias (bibi​): The bias bibi​ adds a constant term to the weighted sum of inputs before applying the activation function. It allows the neural network to adjust and shift its decision boundary.

 3.   Overall System Representation: The algebraic expression ![](https://github.com/rizitis/entangled_photons_neuronic/blob/main/Screenshot%20from%202024-06-15%2019-51-11.png) <br>
 provides a comprehensive view of the neural network's computation, considering both the weighted interactions of inputs and the biases of each neuron.<br>
 
 
 This approach leverages concepts from quantum mechanics to potentially enhance neural network capabilities, particularly in handling complex data patterns and optimizing learning processes. It provides a framework for understanding how quantum-inspired elements can be integrated into traditional neural network architectures.
